Development Log
Team
Day 1: Distribution of tasks
We started by distributing the tasks to every team member. Eduardo was going to make one map window, Aemi the other map window, Andrea the recommendations window and Jetzuvely the main window.
Day 2-Day 5: Sections development
Everyone did their part separately, but considering a style defined on day 2: font-style, color-palette; and a defined structure: as close as possible to what is stated at the webpage proposal document. Even so, each of us was experiencing coding problems because the code was not working as we expected. At the end, we managed to solve the problem by debugging and looking at the presentations, internet information and IA resources.

During these days, we realized that developing the structure for the two map sections was almost the same. The only thing that changed was the information because the maps are about different topics. That’s why we decided to copy one map source code and adapt it for the other map according to their specific needs. Therefore, we decided to assign both map sections to Aemi and let Eduardo put it all together in a webpage. He was in charge of bringing everything together in such a way that it was coherent in style and functionality.
Day 6: Webpage integration
Eduardo integrated our individual pages into a single website, but we had some problems with this part. We didn't know how to use GitHub with different accounts. Eduardo explained to us how to do it and made a mini tutorial, so we managed to bring the maps and recommendations sections together. However, there were still some problems with uploading the main page and we spent hours trying to do so, until Eduardo gathered the files through another means and then uploaded them to our repo’s website.
Day 7 (deadline): Documentation and final details
We completed the final adjustments to our website. When integrating the parts together, the webpage stopped working correctly. We solved the problem by debugging the code and we figured out that the problem was in the links, so we wrote them correctly and the webpage started to work again.
Also, we wrote our personal work reflection and the problems/solutions we faced as a team during the development.
 


Andrea
Personal work reflection
Regarding the website development, I did the recommendations section. I searched for information about sustainable fishing practices, organizations that contribute to the cause, and the place where people can find information about their area’s fishing regulations. I attempted to be congruent with the style that my teammates incorporated to the other windows.
I also learnt about the implementation of the bootstrap grid system in the code and how it helps to organize the webpage better, since it is organized by rows and columns and has attributes that contribute to efficient style development. Also, although we didn't implement a dropdown list for the menu because other methods looked nicer, I learnt how to make a dropdown menu with a bootstrap grid system class.
On the other hand, about teamwork, I consider that I actively participated in the progress of this delivery because not only did I send my part, but I also was following the progress that we were making and I let my team know that they could count on me if there were any further problems. Thus, I tried to maintain communication with the team.
I could have improved my organization skills to deliver my part earlier so that my team could have time to work unhurriedly.
Team work reflection
My teammates actively contributed to the assignment by delivering before the deadline their part of the work. We also communicated throughout the development of this delivery and tried to solve problems together.

Aemi
Personal work reflection
For this project, I was responsible for creating the pages related to maps: Endangered Marine Species and Fishing Activity. I worked on the basic structure of the pages using HTML and applied fundamental CSS elements, like defining colors, layout, and the design structure.

In addition, I also did the research to gather accurate and reliable information for both pages, making use of trustworthy sources such as the FAO, NAA, and other recognized organizations. I also contributed ideas to enhance the visual identity of our website, like suggesting the font style for titles and the color palette. 

Through this work, I was able to improve my skills in web development, particularly in CSS, and  I also learned how to use Bootstrap. Working with my teammates allowed us to build a functional prototype.

I think that my contribution helped to ensure that our website is informative. Although some information is still missing, the essential content and purpose are clear.

Team work reflection
I think that our organization throughout the project was very good. Everyone had a clear role and contributed their part, which made the work more efficient and balanced and we helped each other with our doubts.

Eduardo
Personal work reflection
During this project, my main responsibility was merging all the pages that had been developed. To achieve a smooth merging, I explained to my teammates the basics of GitHub, showing them how to upload their changes and push updates to the main branch. Once all the files were in place, I updated the code references to connect everything properly, ensuring smooth navigation and consistency across the site. This step helped the application feel more cohesive and user-friendly.
I was also responsible for adding headers and footers to every page. To achieve this I used a Header and Footer in html, defining their styles in css. And adding a fade effect to show an introduction image into every page, that once it’s scrolled would make the header opacity go higher .The headers and footers helped to connect the pages and make them feel more cohesive. Including these design features made the overall project more polished and aligned with standard web development practices. 

Team work reflection
I was quite happy about our team's results, and working dynamic. Each member contributed meaningfully, and together we produced a high-quality outcome. We may need to work a little more into getting to know Git better.

Jetzuvely
Personal work reflection
I'm working on a new idea in a different style because I prefer and love design more, that's why I opt for a 3D style, I do this style with a video tutorial and look for information about things that I considered very important not only for this project but in general because I decided to add the stories and partners and educational videos. I did it with div and img, one scrip for java for the scroll in the website, videos and some classes for the design and more efficiently, for example, the title class is very comfortable because it is reusable for some parts of the project. My part was the main page and the first page to start, at the beginning they were very difficult because in the css I want something newer and more interactive and for this I used a combination of tools fonts and sizes colors and more the html is easier because it is more information and classes, the real challenge for me is in the css. (I started on the weekend and finished my part on Monday, the first day I started with the html the skeleton of the website and then defined the look and found it in the css design)
Team work reflection
I think my team's work is incredible. Each person contributes different and important things and good ideas to the design. The name and images are very beautiful. My entire team works together perfectly, they are very punctual and communicate well, the codes are very good.
