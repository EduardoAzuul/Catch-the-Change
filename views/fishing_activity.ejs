        <h2>What Is Illegal Fishing?</h2>
        <p>
            Illegal fishing refers to fishing activities that violate national,
            regional, or international fisheries laws and regulations. Examples
            include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fishing without a license or permit</li>
            <li>Exceeding catch quotas</li>
            <li>Using banned gear or fishing during closed seasons</li>
            <li>Targeting protected species</li>
            <li>
            Operating in areas without permission or contrary to conservation
            measures
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The broader term is IUU fishing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Illegal:</b> Fishing in violation of laws or regulations.</li>
            <li>
            <b>Unreported:</b> Activities not reported or misreported to
            authorities.
            </li>
            <li>
            <b>Unregulated:</b> Fishing in areas lacking management or by
            vessels not subject to applicable rules
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h2>Why It Matters to Avoid Illegal Fishing</h2>
        <p>
            Avoiding illegal fishing is essential because it protects marine
            ecosystems, prevents overfishing, and helps preserve biodiversity. It
            also secures food sources for billions of people and supports the
            livelihoods of millions who depend on fisheries. In addition, reducing
            illegal fishing prevents massive economic losses, which are estimated
            to reach up to 36 billion USD every year. By respecting fishing
            regulations, countries ensure sustainability, fairness, and long-term
            ocean health.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Sanctions and Penalties</h2>
        <p>
            The sanctions for illegal fishing vary across countries but usually
            involve fines, imprisonment, or loss of equipment. For example, in
            India, fines can go up to â‚¹50,000 and include jail time, while in
            Australia, offenders have faced penalties of more than AUD 800,000,
            community service, and even the confiscation of boats and gear. These
            penalties are designed to discourage illegal practices and highlight
            the seriousness of protecting marine resources.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>What Governments Do to Reduce Illegal Fishing</h2>
        <p>
            To reduce illegal fishing, governments and international organizations
            have developed several strategies. These include treaties such as the
            Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA), which prevents illegally caught
            fish from entering markets, and the EU IUU Regulation, which enforces
            strict import controls and sanctions non-cooperating countries.
            Regional operations, like Operation Kurukuru in the Pacific, monitor
            vast ocean areas with the help of multiple nations. Technology also
            plays a key role, with tools such as Global Fishing Watch, which uses
            satellite data to track suspicious vessels in real time. Through laws,
            enforcement, surveillance, and trade restrictions, governments work to
            protect oceans and promote sustainable fishing.

        <h2>Data Accuracy and Limitations</h2>
        <p>
            The figures and examples presented in this page, such as economic losses or
            penalties, are based on available reports and estimates. However, the exact
            numbers may vary due to differences in reporting standards, changes in regulations,
            or unreported activities. Readers should consider these values as indicative rather
            than precise, and consult primary sources for critical decision-making or research purposes.
