                An endangered species is a type of organism, such as plants, animals, microbes, fungus, that is at
                risk of extinction due to a rapid decrease in its population or a loss of its habitat.
            </p>
            <h2>Why do species become endangered?</h2>
            <p>There are two main reasons:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Habitat loss</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Natural causes can lead to habitat loss. For example, dinosaurs became extinct
                            because a sudden climate shift.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Human-driven factors like urban development, agriculture, and deforestation also
                            destroy habitats. For instance, about 20% of the Amazon rainforest has been cleared
                            in the last 50 years to create space for cattle ranches.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Invasive species introduced by humans can further threaten native species and ecosystems.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Loss of habitat can also lead to increased encounters between humans and wildlife. For
                            example, whales may get entangled in fishing gear or struck by boats. Peoplle hunting or
                            accidentally killing wildlife can also contribute to a species´s endangered status.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h3>Loss of genetic variation</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Genetic diversity helps species adapt to environmental changes. However, nowadays,
                            many species have low genetic variation due to small population sizes, inbreeding,
                            and habitat fragmentation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Human activity can also cause a loss of genetic variation. For example, overfishing has
                            reduced the populations of many animals. The pressure on the fishing industry to catch
                            more fish has led to a decrease in the number of healthy adult fish in the wild that can
                            reproduce.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-5">
            <h2>Characteristics of Endangered Species</h2>
            <p>
                Using international criteria, like the IUCN Red List, a species may be labeled endangered based on
                several
                factors.
                Currently, there are more than 169,000 species on The IUCN Red List, with more than 47,000 species
                threatened with extinction,
                including 44% of reef building corals, 37% of sharks and rays, 26% of mammals, 26% of freshwater
                fishes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Red List has nine levels of conservation. Seven of these levels rank how close a species is to
                extinction: least concern,
                near threatened, vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild, and extinct.
                The
                other
                two levels are data
                deficient, meaning that scientists do not have enough information to determine which category they
                belong.
                The other level is
                "not evaluated", which means that the species has not yet been assessed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Classifying a species as endangered has to do with its range and habitat, as well as its actual
                population.
                For this reason,
                a species can be of least concern in one area and endangered in another. For example, the gray whale
                has
                a
                healthy population
                in the eastern Pacific Ocean along the coast of North and South America, however, in the western
                Pacific
                Ocean, the population
                is critically endangered.

                        <p>
                            The vaquita (Phocoena sinus) is the smallest cetacean in the world, whose name means “little
                            cow.”
                            Its most distinctive feature is a dark ring around its eyes, along with a proportionally
                            large dorsal fin.
                            The vaquita is unique among porpoises because it is the only species that lives in warm
                            waters, and scientists
                            believe its large dorsal fin helps release excess body heat.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This species can only be found in the northern part of the Gulf of California, Mexico.
                            Vaquitas are shy and elusive, often avoiding boats. They are usually found in shallow waters
                            up to 50
                            meters deep, where they feed on small fish, squid, and crustaceans.

                            The leatherback turtle is the largest sea turtle species and the only surviving member of
                            the Dermochelyidae family.
                            Unlike other sea turtles, it does not have a hard shell but a leathery, flexible carapace
                            with seven ridges along its back. This unique adaptation makes it one of the most
                            distinctive marine turtles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Leatherbacks are highly migratory, traveling across the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian
                            Oceans. In Mexico, they can be found in the Pacific coast, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of

                            The elkhorn coral, named for its majestic antler-like branches, is a critically endangered
                            reef-building species that plays a vital ecological role across the Caribbean, Gulf of
                            Mexico, Florida, and the
                            Bahamas. Once among the most abundant corals in its range, it has suffered steep declines
                            due to disease,
                            bleaching, storm damage, and human pressures.

                        <p>
                            This coral thrives in clear, shallow waters, often 1 to 5 meters deep, in high-energy zones
                            with strong wave action. It flourished throughout the southern Florida coasts, the northern
